## Nebulas Rank (NR)

Measures value by considering liquidity and propagation of the
address. Nebulas Ranking tries to establish a trustful, computable and deterministic measurement
approach. With the value ranking system, we will see more and more outstanding applications 
surfacing on the Nebulas platform.

##### When will Nebulas Rank (NR) be ready?
> answer here

##### Will dApps with more transactions naturally be ranked higher?
> answer here

##### How does the Nebulas Rank (NR) separate quality dApps from highly transacted dApps?
> answer here

##### Is the Nebulas Ranking algorithm open-source?
> Yes

##### Who can contribute to the algorithm?
> At this time the Nebulas core team is responsible for the development of the algorithm. Over time we will open it up to the community to contribute and vote to determine the future of the algorithm. 

##### Can the Nebulas Rank (NR) algorithm be cheated?
> We will implement strict manipulation controls, and of course the Nebulas Rank (NR) will continually be evolving to meet the needs of the community.

## Nebulas Force (NF)

Supports upgrading core protocols and smart contracts on the
chains. It provides self-evolving capabilities to Nebulas system and its applications. With Nebulas
Force, developers can build rich applications in fast iterations, and the applications can dynamically
adapt to community or market changes.

##### When will Nebulas Force (NF) be ready?
> answer here

##### Can smart contracts be upgraded?
> Yes, [short summary explaining how it works]

##### How is Nebulas Force (NF) smart contract upgrading better than other solutions that are currently or soon-to-be available? 
> answer here

##### Can the Nebulas blockchain protocol code be upgraded without forking?
> Yes, [short summary explaining how it works]

##### Can the Nebulas Virtual Machine (NVM) be upgraded?
> Yes, [short summary explaining how it works]

## Developer Incentive Protocol (DIP)

Designed to build the blockchain ecosystem in a better way. The Nebulas token incentives will help top developers to create more values in Nebulas.

##### When will the Developer Incentive Protocol (DIP) be ready?
> answer here

##### Will there be a limit as to how many rewards one dApp can receive?
> answer here

##### Will developers still be able to do their own ICOs?
> answer here

##### Will only the top Nebulas Rank (NR) dApps receive rewards?
> answer here

##### How often will rewards be given?
> answer here

##### How will you stop cheaters?
> The way the DIP is is designed makes it very hard for cheaters to be successful. Since smart contracts can only be called passively, it would be highly cost ineffective for a user to try to cheat the system. More about this topic can be read in the Technical Whitepaper.

## Proof of Devotion (PoD) Consensus Algorithm

To build a healthy ecosystem, Nebulas proposes
three key points for consensus algorithm: speediness, irreversibility and fairness. By adopting the
advantages of PoS and PoI, and leveraging NR, PoD will take the lead in consensus algorithms.

##### When will the Proof of Devotion (PoD) Consensus Algorithm be ready?
> answer here

##### What consensus algorithm will be used until PoD is ready?
> answer here

##### How are bookkeepers chosen?
> The PoD consensus algorithm uses the Nebulas Rank (NR) to qualify nodes to be eligible. One node from the set is randomly chosen to propose the new block and the rest will become the validators.

##### Do bookkeepers still have to stake?
> Yes, once chosen to be a validator for a new block, the validator will need to place a deposit to continue.

##### How many validators will there be in each set?
> answer here 

##### What anti-cheating mechanisms are there?
> answer here

--- 

## Nebulas Search Engine

Nebulas constructs a search engine for decentralized
applications based on Nebulas value ranking. Using this engine, users can easily find desired
decentralized applications from the massive market.

##### When will the Nebulas Search Engine be ready?
> answer here

##### Will you be able to search dApps not on the Nebulas platform?
> answer here

##### Will the Nebulas Search Engine also be decentralized?
> answer here

##### Will the Nebulas Rank (NR) control the search results ranking?
> answer here

##### What data will you be able to search?
> We plan many different ways to be able to search the blockchain:
> - crawl relevant webpages and establish mapping between them and the smart contracts
> - analyze the code of open-source smart contracts
> - establish contract standards that enable easier searching

## Fundamentals

### Nebulas Name Service (NNS)

By using smart contracts, the Nebulas development
team will implement a DNS-like domain system named Nebulas Name Service (NNS) on the chain while
ensuring that it is unrestricted, free and open. Any third-party developers can implement their own
domain name resolution services independently or based on NNS.

##### When will the Nebulas Name Service be ready?
> answer here

##### When a name is bid on, how long do others have to place their bid?
> answer here

##### How do others get notified that a name is being bid on?
> answer here

##### When a name is reserved who gets the bid amount?
> answer here

##### If I want to renew my name after one year will I need to deposit more NAS?
> answer here

##### Will we be able to reserve names prior to the launch of NNS?
> answer here

### Lightning Network

Nebulas implements the lightning network as the infrastructure of blockchains and offers flexible
design. Any third-party developers can use the basic service of lightning network to develop applications
for frequent transaction scenarios on Nebulas. In addition, Nebulas will launch the worldâ€™s first wallet
app that supports the lightning network.

##### When will lightning network be supported?
> answer here

### The Nebulas Token (NAS)

The Nebulas network has its own built-in token, NAS. NAS plays two roles in the network. First, as the
original money in the network, NAS provides asset liquidity among users, and functions as the incentive
token for PoD bookkeepers and DIP. Second, NAS will be charged as the calculation fee for running
smart contracts. The minimum unit of NAS is 10âˆ’18 NAS.

##### What will happen to the Nebulas ERC20 tokens when NAS is launched?
> answer here

##### Will dApps on the Nebulas platform be able to issue their owns ICOs and tokens?
> answer here

### Smart Contracts

##### What languages will be supported when Main-net launches?
> answer here

##### Will Ethereum Smart Contracts (Solidity) be fully supported? 
> answer here

##### What other language support will follow (and when)?
> answer here
