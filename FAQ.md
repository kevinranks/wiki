# Frequently Asked Questions

This document will focus on the technology behind the Nebulas framework. For broader questions, please view the [Reddit FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nebulas/comments/7nt5y0/frequently_asked_questionsfaq/).

For a better understanding of the Netbulas framework it's highly reocmmended to read the [Nebulas Technical Whitepaper](https://nebulas.io/docs/NebulasTechnicalWhitepaper.pdf).

## Nebulas Rank (NR)

Measures value by considering liquidity and propagation of the
address. Nebulas Ranking tries to establish a trustful, computable and deterministic measurement
approach. With the value ranking system, we will see more and more outstanding applications 
surfacing on the Nebulas platform.

##### When will Nebulas Rank (NR) be ready?

## Nebulas Force (NF)

Supports upgrading core protocols and smart contracts on the
chains. It provides self-evolving capabilities to Nebulas system and its applications. With Nebulas
Force, developers can build rich applications in fast iterations, and the applications can dynamically
adapt to community or market changes.

##### When will Nebulas Force (NF) be ready?
> answer here

### Smart Contracts

##### What languages will be supported when Mainnet launches?
> answer here 

##### What language support will follow (and when)?
> answer here

## Developer Incentive Protocol (DIP)

Designed to build the blockchain ecosystem in a better way. The Nebulas token incentives will help top developers to create more values in Nebulas.

##### When will the Developer Incentive Protocol (DIP) be ready?
> answer here

##### Will the DIP provide enough incentive so that ICOs will not be necessary? 
> answer here

#### Have any proofs been done to show the potential token earnings by popular dApps?
> answer here

## Proof of Devotion (PoD) Consensus Algorithm

To build a healthy ecosystem, Nebulas proposes
three key points for consensus algorithm: speediness, irreversibility and fairness. By adopting the
advantages of PoS and PoI, and leveraging NR, PoD will take the lead in consensus algorithms.

##### When will the Proof of Devotion (PoD) Consensus Algorithm be ready?
> answer here

##### What consensus algorithm will by used until PoD is ready?

## Search engine for decentralized applications

Nebulas constructs a search engine for decentralized
applications based on Nebulas value ranking. Using this engine, users can easily find desired
decentralized applications from the massive market.

##### How will the bidding system for _meaningful names_ work? 
> answer here

##### Will users be able to trade, buy, and sell meaningful names amonst each other with no intermediary? 
> answer here 

### Lightning Network

##### When will lightning network be supported?

## Nebulas Token (NAS)

The Nebulas network has its own built-in token, NAS. NAS plays two roles in the network. First, as the
original money in the network, NAS provides asset liquidity among users, and functions as the incentive
token for PoD bookkeepers and DIP. Second, NAS will be charged as the calculation fee for running
smart contracts. The minimum unit of NAS is 10âˆ’18 NAS.
